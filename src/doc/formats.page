h2. File formats

As of version 0.5, @ctioga2@ supports two file formats, a ``legacy'',
parenthese-based format and a new simpler, space-based format, that
share a whole bunch of features.

h3. Space-based format

In the new space-based format, each line starts with the command name,
and contains a list of space-separated arguments. To include arguments
containing spaces, you need to "quote":#quotes them:

{ctCmdfile: plots/new-format.ct2 }

Options are introduced by a @/@. You can put spaces around the @=@
sign if you want, that's optional.

You can define "variables":#variables inside the file to define
common arguments/options only once.


h3. Old parentheses-and-comma format

Before version 0.5, only one file format was available, based on comma
and parentheses. Don't use it for new stuff, but here is how it looks

{ctCmdfile: plots/old-format.ct2 }

It is deprecated because it was found to be not flexible enough. In
particular, specification of coordinates in this command files is
pretty awkward and counter-intuitive.
