h2. ctioga2 documentation

First, read "that":getting-started.html to get started.

@ctioga2@ is organized into two distinct elements:
* so-called "backends", whose job is to acquire data from whichever
  source you need (text files, mathematical formulas, databases, plain
  binary files). 
* the plotmaker architecture, whose job is to display this data
  according to the current stylistic preferences.

All interaction with @ctioga2@ is done via "commands", that can take
arguments and sometimes optional arguments. The documentation for the
commands is generated automatically from the documentation included
inside @ctioga2@ itself, it can be found "there":commands.html. 

Arguments for the command can have different "types", i.e. values
which are legal for their use, such as numbers, arbitrary text,
predefined values. The documentation for the types in use by @ctioga2@
is also generated automatically from the command-line. It can be found
"there":types.html.

In addition to that, there are examples that demonstrate how to change
various aspects of the plots: 

* hmm... there will be one day.
