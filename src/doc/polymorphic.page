h2. Why polymorphic ?

One of the great advantages of @ctioga2@ over @ctioga@, and actually
over all plotting programs I know, is that it can be used in two
different ways:

* directly from the command-line, specifying the look of the graph
  through command-line arguments;
* using a command file, a bit like files you could use with
  "gnuplot":http://gnuplot.info/.

For instance, running

{ctCmdline: plots/polymorphic-1.ct2-sh }

produces the same graph as running @ctioga2 -f@ on a file containing
this:

{ctCmdfile: plots/polymorphic-2.ct2 }

The use of command-line switches makes it possible to use and abuse
features of the shell, but the text format is simpler to read. 

We have used both ways in the documentation, you can easily
distinguish between both by their background colors.

You can read more about the text format "here":formats.html.


Both ways can be mixed freely, which means you can override various
parameters of a command file with the command-line (or the other way
around), add datasets and so on...
