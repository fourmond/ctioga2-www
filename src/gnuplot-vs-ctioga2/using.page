h2. Data columns

The original gallery can be found
"there":http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/using.html.

{fight: plots/using.1}

@ctioga2@ treats independently lines and markers/symbols, which is not the
case for gnuplot, so instead of simply using @with points@, we have
to disable the drawing of lines with @/line-style no@ and enable the
drawing of markers using @/marker Times@.

{fight: plots/using.2}

Again, for the time being, @ctioga2@ does not support setting the
legend below the graph. Something very important you *must* keep in
mind when using @ctioga2@ is that legends (like the rest) are pure
@LaTeX@  texts, and hence must not contain unescaped @%@ signs (they
are comments and will greatly confuse @TeX@ (and crash @ctioga2@).
