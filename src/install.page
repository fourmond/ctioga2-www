h2. @ctioga2@ installation instructions

* "Windows":#win
* "MacOS":#mac
* "Linux":#linux
* "From source":#source, for those feeling adventurous
* "From the git repository":#git, for those that need the bleeding
  edge version and feel like giving a little help.
* "upgrading instructions":#upgrading



h2(#win). Installing on windows

Before installing @ctioga2@ proper, you need to install

 * "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org, using the "one-click
   installer":http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. The 1.9.3 version
   works just fine. Don't forget to click the box to add the
   executables to the PATH at the end of the installation.
 * The Ruby DevKit, at the same
   "location":http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. Make sure you take
   the one matching the Ruby version you installed (there's an
   explicative text on the side). You need to unpack it in the
   directory where Ruby got installed.
 * A LaTeX distribution, such as
   "proTeXt":http://www.tug.org/protext/, or directly
   "MiKTeX":http://miktex.org/download. They both are heavy downloads,
   MiKTeX is a barebone LaTeX install while with proTeXt you get a lot
   of additional

After installing that, you probably need to reboot, then open a
windows terminal (Start -> Run then @cmd.exe@) and type in:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
gem install ctioga2
</pre>

If @gem@ complains that you didn't install the developer kit while you
are positive that you've unpacked the developer kit where you should,
you can work around that problem by doing:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
cd C:\Ruby193
devkitvars
gem install ctioga2
</pre>

Where we assumed that ruby was installed into the @C:\Ruby193@
directory. You will also have to do that for "upgrading":#upgrading.

Alternatively, you can look at the proper installation instructions
for the developer kit 
"there":https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit.


Then, to make your life easier, it is recommanded to install the
following "registry file":ctioga2.reg that sets up the correct file
associations. In particular, if you now right-click on a @.ct2@ file,
you'll have a "Compile to PDF" action available (as the default).


h2(#mac). Installing on MacOS

In principle, MacOS comes with a version of Ruby bundled in that
should be enough for running @ctioga2@. Make sure you have a LaTeX
distribution installed, if not, install
"MacTeX":http://tug.org/mactex/. Then, open up a terminal, and run

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
gem install ctioga2
</pre>

You may not have the necessary right to do that, in which case you'll
have to run

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
sudo gem install ctioga2
</pre>

And that's it. Running @ctioga2@ from the terminal should be
painless. (there are no file associations at the moment).

h2(#linux). Installing on Linux

h3. With your package manager

For Debian-based distros, just run

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
apt-get install ctioga2
</pre>

h3. Using rubygems

Make sure you have a TeXlive distribution and Ruby installed on your
computer, then run

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
gem install ctioga2
</pre>


h2(#source). From source

Download the latest tarball of @ctioga2@ at the 
"download page":http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctioga2/files/, and extract
it this way:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
tar xvjf ctioga2-0.10.1.tar.bz2
</pre>

Then @cd@ to the directory created. @ctioga2@ uses
"@setup.rb@":http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup/doc/usage.html
for handling its installation. To install for all users, run  as root:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ruby setup.rb
</pre>


h2(#git). From the git repository

Just get the repository at 
"sourceforge":http://sourceforge.net/p/ctioga2/code/:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ctioga2/code ctioga2
</pre>

And then, install as above for the download from sources.

Alternatively, you can use the
"github":http://github.com/fourmond/ctioga2 mirror:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
git clone git://github.com/fourmond/ctioga2.git
</pre>



h2(#upgrading). Upgrading instructions

For those who installed using @gem@ (Windows, MacOS), the easiest way
to upgrade to the lastest @ctioga2@ release is to run:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
gem update ctioga2
</pre>

For the rest, you just install the newer version as if no previous
version was installed.
