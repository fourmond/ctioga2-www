h2. Plotting data and math functions

@ctioga2@ has access to quite a few source of data, through the use of 
"backends":../doc/backends.html. These are objects that acquire data,
usually though the reading of files, but also generating it using
mathematical functions, and make it available to @ctioga2@.

h3. Mathematical functions

By default, @ctioga2@ acquires data using the @text@ backend, that
reads space-separated files (spaces also include tabs). It is possible
to switch to mathematical functions this way:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-1.ct2-sh }

In that example, the X range of the math backend is specified using
the @/xrange@ option (default is @-10:10@, as in @gnuplot@), and the
number of points sampled using the @samples@. These can also be
changed using other commands, such as:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-2.ct2-sh }

This demonstrates that the first curve drawn got 31 samples, while the
second one only got 5. This example also demonstrates another feature
of @ctioga2@: the possibility to plot individual data points using a
small symbol called a @marker@ in "Tioga"http://tioga.rubyforge.org
terminology (we'll come back to that "later":TODO).
