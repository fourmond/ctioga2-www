h2. How to port from @ctioga@ to @ctioga2@

This page is of interest for people who are using 
"@ctioga@":http://sciyag.rubyforge.org/ctioga
and who would like to switch to @ctioga2@.

For the simplest plots, simply changing @ctioga@ to @ctioga2@ should
do the trick. The rest of this page will, _eventually_, cover the most
important specific details.

h3. Themes

Support for themes was dropped completely in @ctioga2@, as they were
more a nuisance than a gain. Equivalent functionality should be easy
to obtain with the various @-set@ commands, especially now that the
sets can be specified easily on the command-line:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ctioga2 --color-set 'Blue|Green|Pink|Orange' 'sin(x + 0##3)'
</pre>


h3. Unimplemented features

As of now, many of <code>ctioga</code>'s features have not been ported
yet to @ctioga2@. The reason is simply that I have not had the time or
seen the utility of those features. If you desperately need them,
please ping me at
"@ctioga2-users@":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ctioga2-users.
