h2. Filled curves

The original gallery can be found
"there":http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/fillcrvs.html.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.1}

Here, we set the {command: color-set} and the {command:
fill-color-set} to @gnuplot@ to have @ctioga2@ colors match those of
gnuplot, in order to facilitate the comparison between the left and
right plots.

Note as well that, as the @(x>3.5 ? x/3-3 : 1/0)@ plot contains
spaces, we had to quote it as @ctioga2@ splits a line into
arguments/options at spaces, a bit like the shell.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.2}

Of course, this does not look good, even with @ctioga2@. It would have
been better to take advantage of fill transparency to avoid redrawing
the first parabola:

{ctCmdfile: plots/fillcrvs.2-better.ct2}

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.3}

Here, implementation is only partial since @ctioga2@ cannot draw axes
lines on top of the graph for the time being.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.4}

With @ctioga2@, one has to use @x.abs@ rather than @abs(x)@ because
the @abs@ function is not part of the 
"Math module":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Math.html
(although this could be arranged later...).

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.5}

Here, it is much smarted to fill the background of the plot rather
than to use a constant value. In addition, this @ctioga2@ plot
demonstrates the @xcolor@-like possibilities to tweak colors:
@Blue!40@ means 40% of @Blue@ mixed with 60% of something else (white
by default).
