h2. @ctioga2@ status

@ctioga2@ has matured enough to reach the stage where most of the old
@ctioga@ features are now available for @ctioga2@. This is why 
"@ctioga@ has been deprecated":http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=38737. 

However, there are still a few minor things that are not handled yet by
@ctioga2@, such as:
* histograms
* many of the old filters
* the binner backend
* and possibly a few more...

In addition, even if for the most common cases @ctioga2@ is just a
drop-in replacement for @ctioga@, it is not always the case. Check out
the "@ctioga@ to @ctioga2@ page":doc/ctioga-to-ctioga2.html for more
information.
