h2. Legends

One important thing with graphs is a legible legend that tells all
that needs to be said... @ctioga2@ provides various ways to do that.

h3. How to specify legends

Legends can either be specified before using the command {cmd: legend}
or as an option to the plot:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-1.ct2-sh }

Additional lines of information can be added using the 
{cmd: legend-line} command. It can be styled to your taste:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-2.ct2-sh }

See how in this case the plot gently expands to leave space for the
legend. When that is not desired, it is possible to use the
@/count-legend@ option of the {cmd: page-size} command:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-3.ct2-sh }

This produces a plot of exactly @9cmx6cm@, counting the legend in,
while without this option the *graph* has a fixed size, but the space
allocated for the legend expands as necessary.
