h2. ctioga2 documentation

The documentation is divided into several parts

* a "tutorial":../tutorial/ that covers most of the aspects of using
  @ctioga2@ (or at least, it eventually will)
* systematic documentations extracted directly from
  <code>ctioga2</code>'s internal documentation, about
  "commands":commands.html, "types":types.html and
  "backends":backends.html. It may be sparse, but it is always
  up-to-date by construction.
* a list of "command-line switches":cmdline.html, also always
  up-to-date

I wish this documentation was more detailed, but unfortunately, I
spend more time developing new features of @ctioga2@ than documenting
the old ones. You're welcome to join in, though !
