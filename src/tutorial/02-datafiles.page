h2. Plotting data and math functions

@ctioga2@ has access to quite a few source of data, through the use of 
"backends":../doc/backends.html. These are objects that acquire data,
usually though the reading of files, but also generating it using
mathematical functions, and make it available to @ctioga2@.

h3. Mathematical functions

By default, @ctioga2@ acquires data using the @text@ backend, that
reads space-separated files (spaces also include tabs). It is possible
to switch to mathematical functions this way:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-1.ct2-sh }

In that example, the X range of the math backend is specified using
the @/xrange@ option (default is @-10:10@, as in @gnuplot@), and the
number of points sampled using the @samples@. These can also be
changed using other commands, such as:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-2.ct2-sh }

This demonstrates that the first curve drawn got 31 samples, while the
second one only got 5. This example also demonstrates another feature
of @ctioga2@: the possibility to plot individual data points using a
small symbol called a @marker@ in "Tioga"http://tioga.rubyforge.org
terminology (we'll come back to that "later":TODO).

The mathematical backend can also generate parametric plots when
giving @:@-separated functions of @t@:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-3.ct2-sh }

h3. Dirty tricks with text files

The default @text@ backend allows for quite a few dirty tricks. First
of all, it can parse CSV(comma-separated values) files, such as 
"this one":plots/data.csv, if you ask it correctly:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-4.ct2-sh }

Heh, comma-separated value, so you just set the input separator to @,@
using @--text-separator@. Simple, isn't it ? The
<notextile>@1:3</notextile> specification, in the absence of data file
to be loaded, applies the the last datafile loaded.

More importantly, is it possible to use any valid Ruby expression as 
column specifications, such as those: 

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-5.ct2-sh }

Here, we plot column 3 times the cube of column 2 as a function of
the square of column 1.

Any data point whose X or Y value is @nan@, (not a number, i.e. the
result of @0.0/0.0@ for instance) is ignored by @ctioga2@. This is the
case for column containing text, for instance. This can be used to
some extent to exclude some data from the plot, using a specification
in the spirit of @if $1 > 10; then $1; else 0.0/0.0; end@. However,
this is rather cumbersome; it is much more interesting to use the
@/where@ option of the @plot@ command:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-6.ct2-sh }

This can be tweaked into very complex relations, if you take into
account the possibility to load more than two columns using the @text@
backend: 

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-7.ct2-sh }

This is just a plot of the first two columns at the points wherer the
third one is greater than @-0.5@. We have used markers and disabled
the plotting of the lines to make this more visible.

h3. Extracting data from gnuplot files

I often use "gnuplot":http://gnuplot.info to plot mathematical
functions, as it is more interactive and more flexible than @ctioga2@
when the aim is to have a feeling about what is it you're plotting
(especially along with "emacs":http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ and
"gnuplot-mode":http://xafs.org/BruceRavel/GnuplotMode). But I don't
like how it looks. So, I wrote a backend to allow @ctioga2@ to plot
data built using @gnuplot@. Imagine you have a
file "@gnuplot.gnu@":plots/gnuplot.gnu that contains the code:

<pre class='examples'>
{includeFile: {filename: plots/gnuplot.gnu, processOutput: false}}
</pre>

You can use the following @ctioga2@ commands to plot @f(x)@ and
@g(x)@, possibly with modifications to the variables:

{ctCmdline: plots/datafiles-8.ct2-sh }

In this example we plot the results of the first plot command (ie
@f(x)@) by simply giving the @gnuplot.gnu@ as
argument. <code>@2</code> selects the second plot, while the @:a=3@
suffix allows to modify the contents of the variables before running
the plots commands. You can actually write any code there, so long as
it is valid @gnuplot@ code.
