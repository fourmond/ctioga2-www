{fight: plots/fillcrvs.1}

Here, we set the {command: color-set} to @gnuplot@ to have @ctioga2@
colors match those of gnuplot, in order to facilitate the comparison
between the left and right plots.

Note as well that, as the @(x>3.5 ? x/3-3 : 1/0)@ plot contains
spaces, we had to quote it as @ctioga2@ splits a line into
arguments/options at spaces, a bit like the shell.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.2}

Of course, this does not look good, even with @ctioga2@. It would have
been better to take advantage of fill transparency to avoid redrawing
the first parabola:

{ctCmdfile: plots/fillcrvs.2-better.ct2}

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.3}

Here, implementation is only partial since @ctioga2@ cannot draw axes
lines on top of the graph for the time being.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.4}

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.5}

Here, it is much smarted to fill the background of the plot rather
than to use a constant value. In addition, this @ctioga2@ plot
demonstrates the @xcolor@-like possibilities to tweak colors:
@Blue!40@ means 40% of @Blue@ mixed with 60% of something else (white
by default).

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.6}

Note that one has to change the @xy=0,1.8@ fill specification to
@xy=0,1.6@ since gnuplot will silently force any point you specify
this way to lie within the plot boundaries, which doesn't make much
sense in my eyes (because it makes it very difficult to draw lines
that go in a precise direction).

There is no way for now to specify an aspect ratio using @ctioga2@.
