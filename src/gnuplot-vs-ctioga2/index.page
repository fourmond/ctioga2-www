h2. Comparing @ctioga2@ and @gnuplot@

When it comes to command-line plotting utilities, there is little
doubt that "gnuplot":http://gnuplot.info is the most used plotting
program. 

I believe, however, that @ctioga2@ does a much better job in most of
the cases. In this page, you will find a "mirror" of gnuplot's 
"demo gallery":http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/.

This demo gallery serves several purposes:
 * I hope this will convince you to switch to @ctioga2@
 * this also serves as a pendant to the 
   "tutorial":../tutorial/index.html
 * it also serves as a kind of todo-list

This page follows more-or-less the layout of the original demo pages.
