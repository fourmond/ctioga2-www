h2. Getting started with @ctioga2@

@ctioga2@ is a command-line based program that can be used to display
quickly data files. For this page, you need the
"@data.dat@":plots/data.dat file which contains four columns: 
x, sin(x), cos(x) and x^2^.

Alternatively, you may download all the files used in this tutorial as
a "ZIP archive":tutorial.zip.

h3. First steps on the command-line

First, let's plot the second and third columns as a function of the
first. We do that this way:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-1.ct2-sh }

The @-X@ "command-line switch":../doc/cmdline.html asks @ctioga2@ to run
"Xpdf":http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/ on the resulting PDF file. The
<notextile><code>@1:3</code></notextile> bit after the 
second instance of @data.dat@ asks @ctioga2@ to plot the
third column as a function of the first (instead of the second as a
function of the first, the default).

Well this plot lacks a title. We can add one using the @--title@
command:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-2.ct2-sh }

The quotes around @A nice title@ are required to prevent the shell
from closing the argument to @--title@ too soon.

@--title@ is what we call in the context of @ctioga2@ a command. They
are the core of the interaction between @ctioga2@ and the user. These
commands can take one or more arguments, such as in this case, the
title.

h3. Options

Well, that is very well, but the title could be made more visible
using a bigger font and color. To achieve that, we will use options to
the @--title@ command.  Many commands accept options; they are listed
in the "commands documentation":../doc/commands.html. They start with a @/@;
a value is given to them using an equal sign. They must be place after
the arguments of the command they apply to. In this case, we will use
the @/scale@ option of the command @--title@ to make the title a bit
bigger, and the @/color@ option to turn it blue.

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-3.ct2-sh }

As can be seen with the @/color@ option in this case, the @=@ sign is
optional (on the command-line).

h3. Command files

One of the uniques features of @ctioga2@ is that it is possible to use
it both on the command-line and from a command-file. Commands from the
command-file have the same name as when they are used from the
command-line (without the double-dashes). They take the same options.

Edit command files with a plain text file editor (emacs, notepad,
etc...). Do *not* save as "rich text" or "formatted text" !

The following file is the exact translation of the
command-line above:

{ctCmdfile: plots/getting-started-4.ct2 }

You run @ctioga2@ on the command-file this way:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ctioga2 -f getting-started-4.ct2
</pre>

Alternatively, on windows, if you installed the 
"registry file":../ctioga2.reg, you just have to double click on the
file to compile it to PDF. In that case, the errors and warnings that
@ctioga2@ gives are stored in a log file with the same name as the
@ct2@ file.

We have tried to mix between these two approaches in the tutorial. You
can spot which is which from the background color, and the nature of
the "download" link (i.e. download for command-file, or
copy-to-clipboard for command-line).

h3. Let's finish this plot !

The above plot isn't bad, but it lacks a few things, such as relevant
X and Y labels, and maybe a horizontal line for the 0 axis. This is
fixed in this version:

{ctCmdfile: plots/getting-started-4-a.ct2 }

Note the use of the @$@ dollar signs to switch to mathematical mode in
LaTeX, as in any normal LaTeX document. 

Starting from @ctioga2@ version @0.9@, it is easy to specify multiline
titles (or axes labels), by making use of the @/text-width@ option: 

{ctCmdfile: plots/getting-started-4-b.ct2 }

As the {command: title} command is too long to fit on one line, it has
been broken in two lines using a @\@. The @\centering@ bit is a LaTeX
command making sure the title is centered (else it would be justified
within the @6cm@ box). The @/shift=1.3@ option means that the center
of the title box will be @1.3@ lines away from the top of the graph
(else, by default, it would be a little too close).


h3. Intermixing command files and command line

Command files can be mixed freely with command-line. Observe the
effect:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-5.ct2-sh }

Here, in addition to what is specified in the command file, we plot
<code>data.dat@'$1:$2*0.5'</code> *before* the command-file and
<code>data.dat@'$1:0.5 * ($2-$3)'</code> *after* the
command-file. These datasets also demonstrate another possibility of
@ctioga2@: arbitrary expressions can be applied to columns: just stick
a dollar sign before all column numbers. You can arbitrarily mix
columns.
