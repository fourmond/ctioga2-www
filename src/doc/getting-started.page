h2. Getting started with @ctioga2@

Here, a very small tutorial, demonstrating:
* a simple usage from command-line
* the use of options (for labels, say) from command-line
* the same example using a file (and how to play with a file)
* the existence of options to the plot command
* the use of options for plots on command-line
* the existence of style-sets...

There should also be a kind of picture explaining how the style is
chosen for every style item.
