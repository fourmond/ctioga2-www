h2. ctioga2's backends

@ctioga2@ acquires all the data it plots using *backends*: these are
abstract sources of data that can map to basically anything: text
files, mathematical formulas, gnuplot files, and why not, differential
equations, binary data, databases... They are selected using the 
"command":commands.html corresponding to their name.

This page documents all the backends for @ctioga2@; it is generated
automatically from the inline documentation of @ctioga2@.
