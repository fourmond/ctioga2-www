h2. What is ctioga2 ?

@ctioga2@ is a powerful command-line based "polymorphic":polymorphic.html
plotting program, based on the 
"Tioga plotting library":http://tioga.rubyforge.org.

It produces publication-quality PDF files; you make yourself an opinion of
those looking at the "gallery":galleries.html.

It is a complete rewrite of 
"@ctioga@":http://sciyag.rubyforge.org/ctioga. Compatibility was 
kept when it was not a problem. Most simple
graphs from @ctioga@ can be used directly with @ctioga2@.

It benefits from several years of experience writing @ctioga@, and in
particular which mistakes to avoid. It features an original
"polymorphic":polymorphic.html interface, which can be driven either
using directly the command-line or through command-files.

h2. Why yet another plotting program ?

Well, for sure, because @ctioga2@ is much better than the rest !!

Hmmm... Maybe not. At least not on every single aspect of
plotting. But I wanted something:
* *fast*: plotting a data file is done within one or two seconds, just
  run something like @ctioga2 -X data.dat@ from a terminal
* *beautiful*: it is based on "Tioga":http://tioga.rubyforge.org, that
  produces high-quality PDF files
* *powerful*: @ctioga2@ offers many features that are not found on
  other plotting systems (at least not all at once), such as gradients
  for successive curves, color maps and countours, nice filled
  curves... Have a look at the "gallery":galleries.html !
* *scriptable*: being a command-line utility, it integrates naturally
  into the power of command-line scripting. It is very easy to animate
  graphs into a movie !
