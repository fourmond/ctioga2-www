h2. @ctioga2@ prerequisites

To have a working copy of @ctioga2@, you need :

* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/;
* a LaTeX distribution, such as "TeXLive":http://www.tug.org/texlive/;
* a recent version of "Tioga":http://tioga.rubyforge.org.

h2. Installation

So far, @ctioga2@ has not been released as a tarball, but you can get
it from the SVN repository. For that, get a "SVN
client":http://subversion.tigris.org/ and get a working copy of the
repository using this command:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
svn checkout http://ctioga2.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/ctioga2
</pre>

@ctioga2@ is using
"@setup.rb@":http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/setup/doc/usage.html
for handling its installation. In short, in the @ctioga2/@ directory,
this should get you started, as @root@:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ruby setup.rb
</pre>
