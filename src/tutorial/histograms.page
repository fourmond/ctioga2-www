h2. Histograms

Starting from version @0.8@, @ctioga2@ is able to make histograms
whose size adjust automatically.

h3. Simple histograms.

Histograms are a plot type in their own right, just like standard 
{cmd: xy-plot} or parametric plots ({cmd: xy-parametric}), switched on
using {cmd: histogram}:

{ctCmdfile: plots/histograms-1.ct2 }

This example file also demonstrates the possibility to mix colorsets
using the @xcolor@-style syntax that is also available for simple
colors.

The histograms are better filled for them to look good.

h3. Tuning spacing

Spacing around the histograms can be tuned using the options to 
{cmd: histogram}. @/gap@ controls the spacing between histogram
groups, whie @/intra_sep@ controls the spacing within a group of
histograms:

{ctCmdfile: plots/histograms-2.ct2 }

As is visible above, it is easy to mix histograms and normal curves
(so long as you remember to disable filling).

h3. Stacked histograms

@ctioga2@ can stack histograms when using the @/cumulative@ option to
{cmd: histogram}. Use @histogram /cumulative=next@ to start a new
group of cumulative histograms. @ctioga2@ automatically add up the
values of the data points.

{ctCmdfile: plots/histograms-3.ct2 }

Of course, nothing stops you from displaying stacked histograms
side-by-side with unstacked ones. Use @/cumulative=no@ to disable
the effect.
