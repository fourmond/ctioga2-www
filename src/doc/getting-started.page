h2. Getting started with @ctioga2@

@ctioga2@ is a command-line based program that can be used to display
quickly data files. For this page, you need the
"@data.dat@":plots/data.dat file which contains four columns: 
x, sin(x), cos(x) and x^2^.

h3. First steps on the command-line

First, let's plot the second and third columns as a function of the
first. We do that this way:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-1.ct2-sh }

The @-X@ option asks @ctioga2@ to run
"Xpdf":http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/ on the produced PDF file
afterwards. The <notextile><code>@1:3</code></notextile> bit after the
second instance of @data.dat@ is simply asking @ctioga2@ to plot the
third column as a function of the first (instead of the second as a
function of the first, which is the default).

Well this plot lacks a title. We can add one using the @--title@
command:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-2.ct2-sh }

The quotes around @A nice title@ are required to prevent the shell
from closing the argument to @--title@ too soon.

@--title@ is what we call in the context of @ctioga2@ a command. They
are the core of the interaction between @ctioga2@ and the user. These
commands can take one or more arguments, such as in this case, the
title.

h3. Options

Well, that is very well, but the title could be made more visible
using a bigger font and color. To achieve that, we will use options to
the @--title@ command.  Many commands accept options; they are listed
in the "commands documentation":commands.html. They start with a @/@;
a value is given to them using an equal sign. They must be place after
the arguments of the command they apply to. In this case, we will use
the @/scale@ option of the command @--title@ to make the title a bit
bigger, and the @/color@ option to turn it blue.

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-3.ct2-sh }




Here, a very small tutorial, demonstrating:
* the same example using a file (and how to play with a file)
* the existence of options to the plot command
* the use of options for plots on command-line
* the existence of style-sets...

There should also be a kind of picture explaining how the style is
chosen for every style item.
