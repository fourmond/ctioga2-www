h2. How to port from @ctioga@ to @ctioga2@

This page is of interest for people who are using 
"@ctioga@":http://sciyag.rubyforge.org/ctioga
and who would like to switch to @ctioga2@.

*Important note:* development of @ctioga@ has stopped in 2009, you are
advised to port your graphs to @ctioga2@ !

For the simplest plots, simply changing @ctioga@ to @ctioga2@ should
do the trick. The rest of this page will, _eventually_, cover the most
important specific details.

h3. Themes

Support for themes was dropped completely in @ctioga2@, as they were
more a nuisance than a gain. Equivalent functionality should be easy
to obtain with the various @-set@ commands, especially now that the
sets can be specified easily on the command-line:

{ctCmdline: plots/ct2ct2-1.ct2-sh}

h3. And what about @ctable@ ?

@ctioga@ came along with a small helper program, @ctable@, that
paralleled the @table@ terminal of "gnuplot":http://gnuplot.info, and
that could be used to quickly manipulate data files. @ctable@ does not
exists with @ctioga2@, but you can reproduce its behavior with the
@--load@ and the @--print-dataset@ commands:

<pre class="examples-cmdline">
ctioga2 --math -L 'sin(x)' -P
</pre>

h3. Unimplemented features

As of now, many of <code>ctioga</code>'s features have not been ported
yet to @ctioga2@. They are listed in the "status page":../status.html.
The reason is simply that I have not had the time or
seen the utility of those features. If you need them,
please ping me at
"@ctioga2-users@":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ctioga2-users
or on the "forum":http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=31837.
