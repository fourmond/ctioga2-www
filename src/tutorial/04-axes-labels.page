h2. Customizing the look of axes and labels

Here are ways to tweak various things about axes and things.

h3. Alternative X or Y axes

It is possible to use different axes for different curves in a single
plot, using @--y2@ or @--x2@:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-1.ct2-sh }

This example also shows how to define the label for the current X and
Y axes; the @-x@ and @-y@ commands provide many options to fine-tune
the look of the labels.

h3. X and Y ranges

It is possible to define the X and Y ranges of the plot thus: 

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-2.ct2-sh }

Alternatively, it is possible to use @--margin@ to leave a certain
fraction of the plots around the data points; to make the reading
easier. In this case, we leave 3%:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-3.ct2-sh }

h3. Log plots

It is possible to use a log scale by passing the @--xlog@ or @--ylog@
commands:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-4.ct2-sh }


h3. Tweaking the looks of axes

It is possible to change the look of each of the sides of the plot
individually using the @--axis-style@ and the companion
@--label-style@ commands that set the style of the axis and of the
labels respectively.

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-5.ct2-sh }
