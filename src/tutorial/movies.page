Starting from  @ctioga2@ version 0.9, you can use the companion script
"@ct2-make-movie@":../doc/movies.html to automatically generate movies
from a @ctioga2@ command file. This new method is much simpler and
more powerful than the old one, which is still described
"there":movies-old.html.

@ct2-make-movie@ runs @ctioga2@ on a command file repetitively, each
time with a different value to the @arg@ variable. Let's try that with
the diffusion of a gaussian heat (or concentration)
distribution. We'll assume that the variable @arg@ holds a certain
value between 1 and 50. Let's first plot a gaussian distribution:

{ctCmdfile: plots/movie-1.ct2 }

In this file, we use the @arg ?= 1.5@ syntax that defines the variable
@arg@ unless it is already defined, as will be the case when called by
@ct2-make-movie@. Then, we just run @ct2-make-movie@ on this file,
using the syntax @1..50:200@ to mean that the @arg@ variable will go
from 1 to 50 in 200 steps:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ct2-make-movie --codec libx264 -p movie-1.ct2 1..50:200
</pre>

This gives "this movie":plots/movie-1.avi. The @--codec libx264@ argument
instructs "ffmpeg":http://www.ffmpeg.org/ to use a H264 encoder for
the movie generation. The @-p@ option triggers the use of @pdftoppm@
for rasterization of PDF files, which is significantly faster than
that from "ImageMagick":http://www.imagemagick.org.
