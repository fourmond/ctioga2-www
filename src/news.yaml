  :title: ctioga2 version 0.10 is out
  :contents: |-
    Release 0.10 of ctioga2 has seen progress in many domains. You can
    now draw PNG or JPEG images in graphs. Text labels (title and
    axes) can now be auto sized (i.e. the will be as large as needed
    to fill the side of the graph). You can now include inline Ruby
    code in command files to make it easy to define functions (for
    math or data processing). Color map specification has been
    extended which, combined with the inclusion of color sets from
    colorbrewer2.org, makes it easy to draw meaningful heat maps in a
    simple way. Of course, this release brings in its load of bug
    fixes and minor updates.

  :title: ctioga2 version 0.9 is out
  :contents: |-
    ctioga2 version 0.9 brings in quite a bit of new features, 
    including functions that can be used to get information from 
    already loaded datasets and perform various computations, more 
    control on axis ticks, and multiline titles and axis labels,

    straightforward: if you know how to make one of the 
    graphs you need, you turn that into a movie !

  :title: ctioga2 is still alive !
  :contents: |-
    Well, it might not be that obvious looking at the Rubyforge project page, but ctioga2 is alive (and kicking, for that matter). I've been too busy lately to advertise any of my work on ctioga2, but many features have been added since the 0.0 release, and I hope to gather that into a proper release some time soon.
    
    Meanwhile, I'm working on a redesign of the website too, and trying to get decent documentation (but that takes time, and that's precisely what I don't have for now !).

  :title: New home for the ctioga2 project
  :contents: |-
    So far, the efforts in developing the successor of ctioga were located in the SciYAG project (<a href="http://sciyag.rubyforge.org" target="_new">http://sciyag.rubyforge.org</a>). Now, thanks to the rubyforge team, ctioga2 has a new home, <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ctioga2" target="_new">http://rubyforge.org/projects/ctioga2</a>. Development is under way in the SVN repository, and a web page is being written. 
    
    The first release of ctioga2 should be expected reasonably soon !
