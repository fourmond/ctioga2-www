h2. Customizing the style of curves

@ctioga2@ provides an automatic styling of curves:

{ctCmdline: plots/curve-style-1.ct2-sh }

As can be seen, the first curves are displayed in various colors (red,
green, blue and cyan), up to the @--color-set pastel1@ command, that instructs
@ctioga2@ to use another color set, @pastel1@, for subsequent
curves. Line style had not changed so far, but it starts to change at
each curve after the @--line-style auto@ command. As a side note,
@--yoffset@ is used here to shift the second set of curves from the
first one.

h3. Overrides

It is possible to override some of the styles either for one curve, or
definitely for the following curves:

{ctCmdline: plots/curve-style-2.ct2-sh }

Commands, such as @--line-style Solid@ override until further use of
this command; using @auto@ as a parameter lifts the overrides. Using
an option, such as here @/color Purple@ allows one to override the
style element just for a single curve.

Commands handling the sets or overrides are all found within the
"curve style":../doc/commands.html#group-curve-style command group.

h3. Markers

It is possible to indicate the position of data points on a curve with
symbols, that are called markers in Tioga's nomenclature: 

{ctCmdline: plots/curve-style-3.ct2-sh }

As can be seen above, the markers symbol, size and color can be tuned
using the options or the corresponding commands. The list of accepted
symbol names can be found in 
"Tioga's documentation":http://tioga.rubyforge.org/doc/classes/Tioga/MarkerConstants.html.
