h2. Filled curves

The original gallery can be found
"there":http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/fillcrvs.html.

{fight: plots/fillcrvs.1}

Here, we set the {command: color-set} and the {command:
fill-color-set} to @gnuplot@ to have @ctioga2@ colors match those of
gnuplot, in order to facilitate the comparison between the left and
right plots.

Note as well that, as the @(x>3.5 ? x/3-3 : 1/0)@ plot contains
spaces, we had to quote it as @ctioga2@ splits a line into
arguments/options at spaces, a bit like the shell.
