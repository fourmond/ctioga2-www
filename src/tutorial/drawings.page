h2. Drawings

@ctioga2@ has a series of functions to draw elements which are not
data points in themselves, but to help understand and read data.

h3. Basic drawings

Let's first annotate a gaussian curve with a line and some text:

{ctCmdfile: plots/drawings-1.ct2}

Note how we used the @eval@ "function":../doc/functions.html to
compute the value of the half-height width.

h3. Tangents

@ctioga2@ features a very simple way to draw tangents on a curve,
using the {command: draw-tangent} command:

{ctCmdfile: plots/drawings-2.ct2}

In the first form, without options, {command: draw-tangent} only draws
an arrow head (in real, a "marker":../markers.html) along the curve at
the position asked (here, @0.3@, which means "at 30 %"). In the second
form, we ask a full line that will extend until @x = 2@. Of course,
you can use also @/xfrom@, @/yto@ and so on. In the last form, one
says how long the arrow is in @y@ units. Beware of the sign, though:
in this case, as the slope is negative, asking for a positive
@/yextent@ makes it go backwards.

h3. Images

Starting from @ctioga2@ version 0.10, it is possible to include JPEG
or PNG images (there are some restrictions on the type of PNG/JPEG
images that can be handled), using the {command: draw-image}
command. We'll use imagemagick's
"rose":http://www.imagemagick.org/image/rose.jpg for the
demonstration: 

{ctCmdfile: plots/drawings-3.ct2}

To include a file, just specify the image file, the top-left corner
and the bottom right corners of the image. By default, @ctioga2@ just
follows your instructions for the corners, which will probably result
in the image's aspect ratio not being respected. If you care, use
either @/aspect-ratio=contract@ or @/aspect-ratio=expand@ to preserve
the aspect ratio by respectively not exceeding the original rectangle
in the first case and not being smaller than it in the second one.
