h2. Cool stuff

This page contains various neat tricks with @ctioga2@.


h3. Colored regions

It is possible to use the @--region@ command to build colored regions
delimited by plotted curves (which is different than 
"filled curves":03-curve-style.html#pre-curve-style-6):

{ctCmdline: plots/cool-stuff-1.ct2-sh }

By default, the curve within the @--region@ are alternatively above
and below the colored region. It is possible to change that for each
curve individually -- including ignoring the curve:

{ctCmdline: plots/cool-stuff-2.ct2-sh }

This example also demonstrates that it is possible to fill the
"reverse" of the region with a different color using the
@/reversed_color@ option.
