h2. Customizing the look of axes and labels

Here are ways to tweak various things about axes and things.

h3. Alternative X or Y axes

It is possible to use different axes for different curves in a single
plot, using @--y2@ or @--x2@:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-1.ct2-sh }

This example also shows how to define the label for the current X and
Y axes; the @-x@ and @-y@ commands provide many options to fine-tune
the look of the labels.

h3. X and Y ranges

It is possible to define the X and Y ranges of the plot thus: 

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-2.ct2-sh }

Alternatively, it is possible to use @--margin@ to leave a certain
fraction of the plots around the data points; to make the reading
easier. In this case, we leave 3%:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-3.ct2-sh }

h3. Log plots

It is possible to use a log scale by passing the @--xlog@ or @--ylog@
commands:

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-4.ct2-sh }


h3. Tweaking the looks of axes

It is possible to change the look of each of the sides of the plot
individually using the @--axis-style@ and the companion
@--label-style@ commands that set the style of the axis and of the
labels respectively.

{ctCmdline: plots/axes-labels-5.ct2-sh }

h3. Controlling tick position and labels

Starting from @ctioga2@ version @0.6@, it is possible to control the
appearance and position of major ticks and tick labels, through the
use of the {command: ticks} command or through various options to the
{command: axis-style} command: 

{ctCmdfile: plots/axes-labels-6.ct2 }

The @/format@ argument to the {command: ticks} command is interpreted
as a
"@sprintf@":http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-sprintf 
format specification.

It is possible to specify the ticks position using the @/major@ and
@/minor@ options to the {command: ticks} command:

{ctCmdfile: plots/axes-labels-7.ct2 }

See how the background lines follow the position
of the major ticks.

Here, we disabled the ticks on the top axis using {command: top} as
they would still follow the usual convention, which would have a
disconcerting effect. A simple way to take care of that is to use
variables:

{ctCmdfile: plots/axes-labels-7-bis.ct2 }

Using the @/labels@ option, you can even specify the exact label for
all the ticks. The price to pay for that level of control is that you
*must* provide manually the location for all the major ticks (and the
minor ones if you want them to show up too).

{ctCmdfile: plots/axes-labels-8.ct2 }
