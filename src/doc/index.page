h2. ctioga2 documentation

Here be ctioga2 documentation:

* backends
* commands (and options)
* command-line/command files
* a list of all commands ?
* manual page
* examples
* types: points, distances, and so on (see overlap with the manual
  page ?)
* some things would probably have to be generated on-the-fly from the
  source code ?
