h2. Why polymorphic ?

One of the great advantages of @ctioga2@ over @ctioga@, and actually
over all plotting programs I know, is that it can be used in two
different ways:

* directly from the command-line, specifying the look of the graph
  through command-line arguments;
* using a command file, a bit like files you could use with
  "gnuplot":http://http://gnuplot.info/.

For instance, running

<pre class='examples'>
ctioga2 --title 'A nice title, for sure' --math 'sin(x)' \
    -x 'The X label' -y 'The Y label'
</pre>

produces the same graph as running @ctioga2 -f@ on a file containing
this:

<pre class='examples'>
title('A nice title, for sure')
math()
plot('sin(x)')
xlabel(The X label)
ylabel(The Y label)
</pre>

If the latter version is more verbose, it is also more easy to edit in
the case of complex plots.


Both ways can be mixed freely, which means you can override various
parameters of a command file with the command-line (or the other way
around), add datasets and so on...
