h2. Getting started with @ctioga2@

@ctioga2@ is a command-line based program that can be used to display
quickly data files. For this page, you need the
"@data.dat@":plots/data.dat file which contains four columns: 
x, sin(x), cos(x) and x^2^.

h3. First steps on the command-line

First, let's plot the second and third columns as a function of the
first. We do that this way:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-1.ct2-sh }

The @-X@ "command-line switch":../doc/cmdline.html asks @ctioga2@ to run
"Xpdf":http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/ on the resulting PDF file. The
<notextile><code>@1:3</code></notextile> bit after the 
second instance of @data.dat@ asks @ctioga2@ to plot the
third column as a function of the first (instead of the second as a
function of the first, the default).

Well this plot lacks a title. We can add one using the @--title@
command:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-2.ct2-sh }

The quotes around @A nice title@ are required to prevent the shell
from closing the argument to @--title@ too soon.

@--title@ is what we call in the context of @ctioga2@ a command. They
are the core of the interaction between @ctioga2@ and the user. These
commands can take one or more arguments, such as in this case, the
title.

h3. Options

Well, that is very well, but the title could be made more visible
using a bigger font and color. To achieve that, we will use options to
the @--title@ command.  Many commands accept options; they are listed
in the "commands documentation":../doc/commands.html. They start with a @/@;
a value is given to them using an equal sign. They must be place after
the arguments of the command they apply to. In this case, we will use
the @/scale@ option of the command @--title@ to make the title a bit
bigger, and the @/color@ option to turn it blue.

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-3.ct2-sh }

As can be seen with the @/color@ option in this case, the @=@ sign is
optional (on the command-line).

h3. Command files

One of the uniques features of @ctioga2@ is that it is possible to use
it both on the command-line and from a command-file. Commands from the
command-file most often have the same name as when they are used from
the command-line (the double-dash form). They take the same
options. The following file is the exact translation of the
command-line above:

{ctCmdfile: plots/getting-started-4.ct2 }

You run @ctioga2@ on the command-file this way:

<pre class='examples-cmdline'>
ctioga2 -f getting-started-4.ct2
</pre>

@ctioga2@ does not care about the extension of the files. @.ct2@ is
neat though.

h3. Intermixing command files and command line

Command files can be mixed freely with command-line. Observe the
effect:

{ctCmdline: plots/getting-started-5.ct2-sh }

Here, in addition to what is specified in the command file, we plot
<code>data.dat@'$1:$2*0.5'</code> *before* the command-file and
<code>data.dat@'$1:0.5 * ($2-$3)'</code> *after* the
command-file. These datasets also demonstrate another possibility of
@ctioga2@: arbitrary expressions can be applied to columns: just stick
a dollar sign before all column numbers. You can arbitrarily mix
columns.
