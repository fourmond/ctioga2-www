h2. Legends

One important thing with graphs is a legible legend that tells all
that needs to be said... @ctioga2@ provides various ways to do that.

h3. How to specify legends

Legends can either be specified before using the command {cmd: legend}
or as an option to the plot:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-1.ct2-sh }

Additional lines of information can be added using the 
{cmd: legend-line} command. It can be styled to your taste:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-2.ct2-sh }

See how in this case the plot gently expands to leave space for the
legend. When that is not desired, it is possible to use the
@/count-legend@ option of the {cmd: page-size} command:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-3.ct2-sh }

This produces a plot of exactly @9cmx6cm@, counting the legend in,
while without this option the *graph* has a fixed size, but the space
allocated for the legend expands as necessary.

h3. Legends inside the plot

I don't like much having the legends on the side, as it tends to leave
a lot of white space, though admittedly sometimes there's no way
around it. @ctioga2@ allows to place the legends *inside* the plot,
using the {cmd: legend-inside} command:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-4.ct2-sh }

The @tc@ specification requests to place the top center of the legend
at the top center of the graph. Placement can be refined by giving an
additional coordinate specification:

{ctCmdline: plots/legends-5.ct2-sh }

This @lt:0.1,0.82@ means: place the top left corner of the legends at
the position @0.1,0.82@ (counting from the bottom left corner; @1,1@
is the top right corner of the plot).

It additionally demonstrates the use of options to 
{cmd: legend-inside} that can be used to tweak the look of the legend,
such as its size and spacing between consecutive lines. 
{cmd: legend-style} takes the same options, but without imposing the
placement (which can be useful to tweak the look of the outer legends).

h3. Fancy legend frames 

Using the @/frame_@ options to {cmd: legend-inside} or to 
{cmd: legend-style}, one can draw possibly filled frames around the
legend. Using a fill transparency, it is even possible to dim what is
underneath (text never gets dimmed this way, though):

{ctCmdfile: plots/legends-6.ct2 }

Here, we also demonstrate a frame with rounded corners using the
option @/frame-shape=round@.

Try using a white background too !

h3. Multicolumn legends

With the {cmd: legend-multicolumn} command, one can lay out parts of
the legend in several columns:

{ctCmdfile: plots/legends-7.ct2 }

Only the legends of objects between the calls to 
{cmd: legend-multicolumn} and {cmd: legend-multicolumn-end} are laid
out in several columns. Spacing between the columns can be fine-tuned
using the @/dx@ option to {cmd: legend-multicolumn}.

h3. Fine-tuning of legends

Many aspects of the appearance of the legends can be fine-tuned using
options to {cmd: legend-style} or directly {cmd: legend-inside}, such
as the overall size of the pictogram and the size of the symbol:

{ctCmdfile: plots/legends-8.ct2 }
