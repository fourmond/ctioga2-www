h2. @ctioga2@ status

Currently, @ctioga2@ is in a alpha stage, and lacks several features
that were important in @ctioga@, such as:
* tangents
* error bars
* filled curves
* histograms
* many filters 
* transparency
* region delimitation and coloring
* double X or Y graphs
* and many more for now

However, @ctioga2@ has already proven much easier to maintain, develop
and extend. There are quite a few functionalities that were completely
absent in @ctioga@, mostly because they were too cumbersome or too
delicate to implement. In particular, @ctioga2@ offers much more
control over the look of things that the old @ctioga@ did.
