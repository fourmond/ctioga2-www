h2. List of color names

Here is the complete list of color names known to @ctioga2@. Of
course, if the color you want is missing, you can specify its RGB
value using HTML notation, like @#FF0000@ for red, or using
comma-separated numbers: @1,0,0@ is also red (@1@ is the maximum
intensity).

h2(#colorsets). List of color sets

<code>ctioga2</code>'s curves line colors and marker colors are varied
automatically from one curve to the next by choosing successive colors
in "color sets". All the available named color sets are represented
below, but keep in mind that you can define easily colorsets by using
a @|@ sign, like in {cmd: color-set} @Red|Pink|Purple@. Keep in mind
as well that all color sets can be used directly as {type: colormap}.

colorbrewer ones)"/></p>

@ctioga2@ has been augmented with most of the color sets that were
developed by Cynthia Brewer
("http://colorbrewer.org/":http://colorbrewer.org/). You are invited
to look there to find out about them. Alternatively, the "gnuplot
port":https://github.com/aschn/gnuplot-colorbrewer also contains
useful information on how to make us of them. The full list is given
below:
