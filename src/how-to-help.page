h2. How to help @ctioga2@ development ?

@ctioga2@ is developed by volunteers during their free time. So help
is always welcome. Here are various things where you could get
involved:

* Documentation: @ctioga2@ is always in dire need of clear and precise
  documentation assorted with good examples. If you like to write but
  not too much to code, this is a job for you.
* Porting features from the old @ctioga@: @ctioga2@ is far behind
  @ctioga@ in terms of te quantity of features implemented, even if
  what is already implemented is now much better done. Pick up what
  you need and code !
* Adding new features to @ctioga2@. You need something ? Just write it
  !

h3. How do I get going ?

You have two options, depending on which SCM you enjoy using

* You can hack directly on the 
  "master SVN repository":http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=8218
  at "Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org. You'll have to use anonymous
  access.
* Alternatively, you can clone the 
  "git mirror":http://github.com/fourmond/ctioga2 at 
  "github":http://github.com. Using @git@ will probably make it
  simpler to share patches/commits. However, the @git@ repository may
  be lagging behind the SVN one at times...

In any case, for help and advice, either use the
"forums":http://rubyforge.org/forum/?group_id=8218 or the
"@ctioga2-users@":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/ctioga2-users
mailing list.
