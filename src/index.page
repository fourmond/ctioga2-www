h2. What is ctioga2 ?

ctioga2 is a powerful non-interactive polymorphic plotting program. 



SciYAG is a long term project to provide the scientific community a good
set of tools to plot and analyze data. It is structured in different 
subprojects:

* "ctioga":ctioga/index.html is a command-line interface for the wonderful 
  Ruby plotting library, Tioga.

* Backends is a set of ruby libraries used to fetch data from files. 
  It is used internally by ctioga and SciYAG. You can however profit
  directly from it's ease of use. Have a look at it's current
  "documentation":rdoc/Backends.

* MetaBuilder is a complete system for type-safe user interaction written
  in pure Ruby. It features for now an interface to command-line parsing
  and to Qt widgets.

* "SciYAG":sciyag/ itself is a graphical program to organize, display
  and search scientific data.

* SCalc is a C++/Ruby library to efficiently compute the result of a
  mathematical expression. It should provide derivation of the formulas 
  (useful for fits, for instance). Only the C++ code is written for now;
  it is accessible in the 
  "SVN repository":http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=1477, 
  module @SciYAG/SCalc@.

h2. Support, bugs and feature requests

We cannot offer you any support at the moment, as the SciYAG project
is essentially based on good will. However, if you find a bug,  we'll
be glad to tackle it. And if you're interested in a feature that also
sounds interesting to us, just let us know... or even better,
implement it and send us a patch !

All this can be done on the Rubyforge "project
page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/sciyag/.
