h2. What is ctioga2 ?

ctioga2 is a powerful non-interactive "polymorphic":polymorphic.html
plotting program, based on the 
"Tioga plotting library":http://tioga.rubyforge.org.

It produces high-quality PDF files.

It is a complete rewrite of the
"@ctioga@":http://sciyag.rubyforge.org/ctioga plotting
program. Compatibility was kept when it was not a problem. Most simple
graphs from @ctioga@ can be used directly with @ctioga2@.

It benefits from several years of experience writing @ctioga@, and in
particular which mistakes to avoid. It features an original
"polymorphic":polymorphic.html interface, which can be driven either
using directly the command-line or through command-files.

h2. Support, bugs and feature requests

We cannot offer you any support at the moment, as ctioga2 is developed
during our free time. However, if you find a bug, we'll be glad to
tackle it. And if you're interested in a feature that also sounds
interesting to us, just let us know... or even better, implement it
and send us a patch !

All this can be done on the Rubyforge "project
page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/ctioga2/. Alternatively, you can
send an email to the mailing list @ctioga2-users@ at @rubyforge.org@.
