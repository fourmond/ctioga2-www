h2. Fill between curves

The original gallery can be found
"there":http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/fillbetween.html.

{fight: plots/fillbetween.1}

You can see that the approach between gnuplot and @ctioga2@ is very
different. While gnuplot has a predefined plotting style that lets you
color something that is between two values, @ctioga2@ is more flexible
and lets you draw a region that is defined by an arbitrary number of
*curves*. See more about that "there":../tutorial/cool-stuff.html.

{fight: plots/fillbetween.2}

As of now, @ctioga2@ does not support patterned fills, hence only the
partial support here. Transparency was used instead.

{fight: plots/fillbetween.3}

Here, the difference between @ctioga2@ and gnuplot is even more marked
than for the previous examples: no need to plot the curves twice !
