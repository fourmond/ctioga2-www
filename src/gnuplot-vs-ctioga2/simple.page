{fight: plots/simple.1}

In @ctioga2@, you have to select the {command: math} backend before
you can plot mathematical functions.

In the absence of the {command: auto-legend}, @ctioga2@ simply does
not give legends to datasets that don't already have an explicit
legend.

{fight: plots/simple.2}


{fight: plots/simple.3}

Here, the command {command: xrange} is necessary as in @ctioga2@, the
X range of the mathematical function is not related to the X range of
the display: by default, the display fits the contents, and as there
are no points outside the [-1:1] segment, @ctioga2@ automatically
zooms into that segment.
